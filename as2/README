: I implement the operation part of assignment 2.



Explanation of Assignment 2
1. Item 1 of the section Operation
: I establish struct socket_descripts for following information of each socket in client side. We may get sockfd, ip_addr and net_mask member of this sturuct from Get_ifi_info_plus function which the professor give us. Next step, we should calculate subnet address through ip_addrs & net_mask. At this point, according to the instruction, we would get longest prefix subnet mask address. This is because that when server and client is connected in same local network, we should use ip_addr and net_mask with longest prefix subnet mask due to decreasing packet in the network. I will explain how to get longest subnet mask. In the client side, each multi-homed IP is calculated by BIT AND operation with their own net_mask. Also, host IP address is calculated with same way of the previous case. If both output is same, host and client should be in same local network. We may do iterlatively with every multi-homed IPs. After that, the biggest sbunet mask(i.e. the longest subnet mask) is determined, and its ip_addr and net_mask can be used as the client address to access the host.   

struct socket_descripts
{
	int sockfd;
	struct in_addr *ip_addr;
	struct in_addr * net_mask;
	struct in_addr *subment;
}
